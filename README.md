# Contracts [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/paulrberg/contracts/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://coveralls.io/github/paulrberg/contracts?branch=main) [![Styled with Prettier](https://img.shields.io/badge/code_style-prettier-ff69b4.svg)](https://prettier.io) [![Commitizen Friendly](https://img.shields.io/badge/commitizen-friendly-brightgreen.svg)](http://commitizen.github.io/cz-cli/) [![License: WTFPL](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-WTFPL-yellow.svg)](https://spdx.org/licenses/WTFPL.html)

**Off-the-shelf Solidity smart contracts.** Built with my beloved [Solidity template](https://github.com/PaulRBerg/solidity-template).

- Designed for Solidity >=0.8.0
- Complementary to [OpenZeppelin Contracts](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts)
- Promotes [PRBMath](https://github.com/hifi-finance/prb-math) as a good choice for a fixed-point math library for
  Solidity
- Well-documented via NatSpec comments
- Tested with Hardhat and Waffle

I created this library for my own use,to avoid having to maintain the same contracts in different repositories. If
you find it useful too, it's a win for the of us.

## Caveat Emptor

This is experimental software and is provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis. I do not give any warranties and will not be liable for any loss, direct or indirect through continued use of this codebase.

## Installation

With yarn:

```sh
$ yarn add @paulrberg/contracts
```

Or npm:

```sh
npm install @paulrberg/contracts
```

I adhere to [semver](https://semver.org/), which means that your contracts won't break unexpectedly when upgrading to a
newer minor version of `@paulrberg/contracts`.

## Usage

Once installed, you can use the contracts like this:

```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.8.0;

import "@paulrberg/contracts/math/PRBMathUD60x18.sol";
import "@paulrberg/contracts/token/erc20/Erc20.sol";
import "@paulrberg/contracts/token/erc20/Erc20Permit.sol";

contract MyToken is Erc20, Erc20Permit {
  using PRBMathUD60x18 for uint256;

  constructor(
    string memory name_,
    string memory symbol_,
    uint8 decimals_
  ) Erc20(name_, symbol_, decimals_) {}
}

```

## Contributing

### Pre Requisites

Before running any command, make sure to install dependencies:

```sh
$ yarn install
```

### Compile

Compile the smart contracts with Hardhat:

```sh
$ yarn compile
```

### TypeChain

Compile the smart contracts and generate TypeChain artifacts:

```sh
$ yarn typechain
```

### Lint Solidity

Lint the Solidity code:

```sh
$ yarn lint:sol
```

### Lint TypeScript

Lint the TypeScript code:

```sh
$ yarn lint:ts
```

### Test

Run the Mocha tests:

```sh
$ yarn test
```

### Coverage

Generate the code coverage report:

```sh
$ yarn coverage
```

### Clean

Delete the smart contract artifacts, the coverage reports and the Hardhat cache:

```sh
$ yarn clean
```

## Security

While I set a high bar for code quality and test coverage, you shouldn't assume that this library is completely safe to use. The contracts
have not yet been audited by a security researcher. If you discover any security issues, please report them via [Keybase](https://keybase.io/paulrberg).
